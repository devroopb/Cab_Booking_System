# Cab_Booking_System

This project revolves around the correlation of different features in a cab booking system. In order to understand what leads to more cabs being booked, we first explore the data available to us. 

I use Python3 (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn) to explore and visualise the data. With the help of label encoding, I am able to include categorical features into my analysis.

The trends and correlation are visually represented using:

Histograms,\
Column Charts,\
Scatter Plots,\
Heatmaps,\
Pair Plots,\
Box Plots,\
Violin Plots.

The outliers are removed, followed by the application of 8 different regression models:

Lasso,\
Linear Regression,\
Decision Tree,\
SVM,\
SVM GridSearchCV,\
Random Forest,\
Random Forest GridSearchCV,\
AdaBoost.

The models were trained and tested on the dataset and RMSE was used to determine the accuracy of each model.
